### Objective

Using JavaScript and React, the challenge is to build out a URL shortening web app, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs), and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

URL shortening is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "http://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://goo.gl/aO3Ssc ".

The challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. Both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to along with active states.

All the required assets can be found in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that best judgment for styles will be needed such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information, such as color palette and fonts.
